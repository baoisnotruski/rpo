We developed a platform that you will love to use. Dedicated IT recruiters handpick the best resumes and screen top potentials. What you get are recommendations that strongly match your ideal candidate.

#### Talent Management Tool
We provide our partners with their own talent management tool where they can track and manage not only our candidate endorsements but their in-house candidates as well. Through this tool, they can easily move candidates, automate email communications, and streamline coordination with their hiring partners.

#### Partnership over Transaction
We treat our clients as business partners. When we endorse a candidate, we consider the impact that they will make in an organization. We believe that the tech community can grow if we go beyond completing transactions and into establishing connections. 

#### Cost-Efficient
We offer the most cost-efficient pricing model in the market to date. We are able to do this by reiterating our existing workforce solutions to this platform. 

### Roadmap to Partnership

#### Identify
Together with an IT recruiter, we will discuss the skillset and attitudes that make the perfect candidate. We analyze your business needs to identify the A-list candidate. 

#### Shortlist
We provide you with a shortlisted candidate pool. Using our applicant tracking system, you can efficiently go through our recommendations and engage them in the next step of the process. 

#### Interview
The fun part: where process and intuition come together. After thoroughly going over the resume, you will get a sense of which candidate make a good fit for your team.

#### Hire
Bring the right talent in. Job done 

#### Post-placement
It's always good to have a Plan B. In the event that our endorsement leaves the company within 3 months, we'll provide a replacement in a month free of charge or return the fee if weâ€™re not able to.
